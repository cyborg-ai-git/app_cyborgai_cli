# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current GitHub Actions workflow for building releases is failing due to dependency issues when installing clang on Ubuntu runners. The workflow attempts to install system packages that have complex dependencies, leading to package resolution failures. This feature will migrate the CI/CD build process to use official Rust Docker images that come pre-configured with all necessary build tools, eliminating dependency issues and providing more reliable, reproducible builds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to build releases reliably without dependency conflicts, so that releases can be created consistently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN the system SHALL use official Rust Docker images instead of installing Rust on bare Ubuntu runners
2. WHEN building for Linux targets THEN the system SHALL complete the build without package dependency errors
3. WHEN the workflow encounters build issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages that are related to the actual build process, not system package installation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want the build environment to be consistent and reproducible, so that builds work the same way locally and in CI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Docker images THEN the system SHALL use the same Rust toolchain version (nightly-2025-06-20) as specified in rust-toolchain.toml
2. WHEN building cross-platform binaries THEN the system SHALL include all necessary cross-compilation tools in the Docker environment
3. WHEN developers run builds locally THEN they SHALL be able to use the same Docker images for consistent results

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to support all required build targets, so that users can download binaries for their platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building Linux targets THEN the system SHALL support both x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu and x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
2. WHEN building with Docker THEN the system SHALL include git and other necessary tools for accessing private repositories
3. WHEN cross-compiling THEN the system SHALL include zigbuild and other cross-compilation tools in the Docker environment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be efficient and fast, so that CI/CD pipelines complete in reasonable time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Docker images THEN the system SHALL cache Docker layers to reduce build time
2. WHEN installing Rust toolchains THEN the system SHALL use pre-installed toolchains from the Docker image when possible
3. WHEN building multiple targets THEN the system SHALL run builds in parallel using matrix strategies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to handle authentication properly, so that private dependencies can be accessed during builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in Docker containers THEN the system SHALL properly pass GitHub tokens for private repository access
2. WHEN configuring git authentication THEN the system SHALL work within the Docker container environment
3. WHEN accessing private repositories THEN the system SHALL maintain the same authentication mechanism as the current workflow
