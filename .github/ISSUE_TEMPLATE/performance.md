## ‚ö° Performance Issue

<!-- Describe the performance problem -->

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Current Performance
- **Operation**: [e.g., startup time, file loading, search]
- **Current Time**: [e.g., 5.2 seconds]
- **Expected Time**: [e.g., < 1 second]
- **Frequency**: [e.g., every startup, per search query]

### Measurement Method
<!-- How did you measure the performance? -->

```bash
# Commands used to measure performance
time cargo run
# or
./scripts/run_benches.sh
```

## üîÑ Steps to Reproduce

<!-- Steps to reproduce the performance issue -->
